The code featured in this repository was developed with the goal of
implementing image processing techniques as a tool to learn more about
programming and the mathematical tools utilized in the field.
As such, their performance is severely impacted by the not-so optimal
implementation of the mathematics involved in these processes.

Small sized images are recommended when utilizing the code available here.
