Image processing algorithms - by Pedro Lucca Pereira

####################################################

The code featured in this repository was developed with the goal of implementing image processing techniques as a tool to learn more about programming and the mathematical tools utilized in the field. As such, they aren't heavily optimized and their processing time is severely impacted by the not-so optimal implementation of the logic involved in these processes.

Using small sized images is recommended when utilizing the code available here.
