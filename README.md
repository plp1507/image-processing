Image processing algorithms - by Pedro Lucca Pereira

###############

    The code featured in this repository was developed with the goal of
implementing image processing techniques as a tool to learn more about
programming and the mathematical tools utilized in the field.

    As such, their performance is severely impacted by the image sizes
and the not-so optimal implementation of the mathematics involved in these
processes.
